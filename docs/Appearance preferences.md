# Appearance preferences

### Changing how QuickTabs looks

A number of view options can be changed from the `View` section of the context menu. This includes:

 * Dark mode or light mode
 * A larger fretboard with larger frets
 * A compact context menu which forces it into collapsed style
 * Enable/disable fret counter
 * Enable/disable fret navigation dots

I plan in the future to switch to a highly configurable "theme" style of settings.

### Persistence

View preferences will automatically persist between all opens and updates. Saving happens automatically when a setting is changed.
