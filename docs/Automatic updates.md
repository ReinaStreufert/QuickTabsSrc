# Automatic updates

QuickTabs will automatically download and install the latest stable release of the appropriate architecture on startup. When QuickTabs detects an update, it will request to elevate to administrator privileges so it can write the new files. You may decline the update by denying admin privileges, and QuickTabs will start like normal. Updates usually take about 20 seconds to download depending on the speed of your internet connection. If you start QuickTabs offline it will not detect updates.
