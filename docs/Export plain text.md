# Export plain text

### About export plain text

Export plain text allows you to generate a text-based tab diagram from your QuickTabs tab. It includes a live preview and several customization options.

### Metadata options

These options allow you to customize which document properties are included at the beginning of the tab.

### Staff style

Export plain text offers two styles of tab diagram: `QuickTabs style` and `Standard spaced`. `QuickTabs style` was created to offer a way to include note lengths in the diagram. By not including an empty spacing step between each eighth note as is traditional, QuickTabs can use the `>` character to represent that a note should be sustained for a certain length of time. In `QuickTabs style`, double-digit fret numbers are handled by making only that step 2 characters with a whitespace character on the lines that are not 2-digits. `Standard spaced` is the traditional way of writing tabs where every step gets 2 characters no matter its content, and where not length notation is not supported.

I honestly think that standard spaced looks better, but QuickTabs style works better.

### Wrapping

Wrapping can be enabled or disabled. If it is disabled, the entire staff will be written on one row (still a line for each string of course). If enabled, the staff will break every desired number of measures.
