### About printing

QuickTabs allows you to print the currently opened tab to a printer or pdf document. It will display the tab mostly how it is shown in the editor except it will be displayed on the size of document of your choosing and it will always have a white background even when your editor is in dark mode. You can open the print menu using `File->Print` or `Ctrl+P`.
