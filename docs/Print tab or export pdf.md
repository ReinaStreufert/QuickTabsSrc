### About printing

QuickTabs allows you to print the currently opened tab to a printer or pdf document. It will display the tab mostly how it is shown in the editor except it will be displayed on the size of document of your choosing and it will always have a white background even when your editor is in dark mode. You can open the print menu using `File->Print` or `Ctrl+P`. The print menu has a live preview so you can see how changes to the options will affect your document's appearance. Info about each option in the print menu is given in the "About each print option" section of this doc.

### Using print to make PDFs

Most modern systems support setting the destination printer to "Print to PDF" or "Microsoft print to PDF" which will bring up a file dialog box when you select the print button. This allows you to save the document to a PDF instead of printing it on paper.

### Print preview

The print preview will stay up to date automatically when you change options. You can zoom in or out of the preview and set which page you are previewing using the inputs above it.

### About each print option

**Printer**

The printer dropdown is where you select which printer should be the destination for the document. Setting the printer also tells the print menu which options are possible (such as double sided and color printing, and the possible paper sizes)

**Scale**

The scale property changes how large the tab should be drawn on the paper. Note that this is completely separate from the zoom input for the preview, which does not affect how the document will print but only zooms in on the already generated preview. Changing the scale will affect how many pages QuickTabs produces, how visible the tab is, and where the tab gets wrapped/broken along the edges.

**Use color**

Whether to use color when printing if available. Note that this changing this property does not alter the preview (but does alter printing.)

**Print double sided**

Whether to use double sided printing if available. This also will not alter the preview in any way.

**Landscape**

Whether to treat the paper as if its wider than large by printing sideways allowing for more horizontal space (but less vertical space.)

**Include title page**

If you select this option, QuickTabs will automatically generate a title page to be the first page of your document. The title page will include the song name, time signature, tempo, and tuning.

**Paper size**

This dropdown lets you set the paper size depending on which sizes the printer supports.

**Margins**

This is the amount of blank space to leave on the sides of the paper for aesthetic and printing error mitigating reasons.

**Copies**

How many copies should be printed.
