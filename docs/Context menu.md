# Context menu

### About the context menu

The context menu is the strip of controls at the top of the window. It is split into sections by category with multiple suboptions available in each section. Many parts of these docs will refer to options in the context menu through a format like this: `Section->Suboption`. Many context menu options have keyboard shortcuts. A full list of keyboard shortcuts can be found int [List of all shortcuts](/docs/List%20of%20all%20shortcuts.md). The context menu has two display modes: all icons, and collapsed mode. If you have `View->Compact context menu` turned on, it will always display in collapsed mode. Otherwise, it will display in all icons mode if the window is wide enough and collapsed mode otherwise.

### All icons mode

In all icons mode, every icon is shown for every suboption in every category. Hovering over each icon will immediately show a tool tip labelling the suboption. Click the icon to select it.

### Collapsed mode

The context behaves like a traditional one in collapsed mode, only showing buttons for each section. When you click on a section, it will bring down a dropdown showing its suboptions.
